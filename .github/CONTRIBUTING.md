## Setting up the development environments

### Download git and Docker + Docker Compose

1. [Download and install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. [Download docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Setting up the frontend

We're using **`Node`** on the frontend. I personally use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node environments for me but you can also [download Node directly from their website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setting up the backend
