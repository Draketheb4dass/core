## An overview

GraphOwls is an open-source platform designed to assist with intelligence investigations. It offers a range of tools and features that enable investigators to collect, analyze, and visualize data from various sources. Below we will explore the key components of GraphOwls, their benefits, and how it can help enhance your OSINT capabilities.

### Data Collection

GraphOwls supports a wide range of data sources, including network information, search engines, and custom APIs. Users can easily configure and connect to these sources, pulling relevant data into their investigations.

### Plugin System

The plugin system is a core feature of GraphOwls that allows users to create, modify, and share plugins for specific tasks. This provides a flexible and customizable approach to data gathering and analysis, ensuring that GraphOwls remains adaptable to the ever-changing landscape of open-source intelligence.

### Visualization

To aid in the understanding of complex data sets, GraphOwls offers an intuitive visualization system that enables users to create interactive graphs of information that can be explored and transformed into new types of data. This helps investigators to better comprehend the relationships between data points, entities, and networks, making it easier to identify leads or potential targets.
