# GraphOwls Contributor Agreement

This is a reference copy of the terms of the GraphOwls Contributor Agreement.

Thank you for your interest in GraphOwls. In order for You (as defined below) to make intellectual property Contributions (as defined below) now or in the future to any of the GraphOwls projects, You must agree to this GraphOwls Contributor Agreement ("OCA"). If You have any questions about this agreement, licensing, or anything related to intellectual property at GraphOwls, please send an email to [oss@GraphOwls.com](mailto:support@graphowls.com).

Please read this OCA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting the OCA, You are agreeing to be bound by its terms. If You want to accept this OCA, complete the form completely, print a copy for Your records, and when ready, press the “Accept” button at the end of this form.

As used in this OCA:

- **(i)** “You" (or "Your") shall mean the entity that is making this Agreement with the GraphOwls project; 

- **(ii)** "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by You to GraphOwls for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the GraphOwls projects; and 

- **(iii)** “Submit” (or “Submitted”) means any form of communication sent to GraphOwls (e.g. the content You post on electronic mailing lists, forums, content management systems, source code control systems, code review systems, issue tracking systems, etc. that are used by GraphOwls).

This agreement applies to all Contributions You Submit.

This OCA, and the license(s) associated with the particular GraphOwls projects You are contributing to, provides a license to Your Contributions to GraphOwls and downstream consumers, but You still own Your Contributions, and except for the licenses provided for in this OCA, You reserve all right, title and interest in Your Contributions. In addition to the above, You grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license of all necessary rights under Your copyright in and to Your Contributions (the “Specification Grant”):

- **(a)** for GraphOwls (and its contributors solely as a part of GraphOwls projects) to create, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense specifications subject to the terms of the then-current GraphOwls projects, based on or derived from the Specification Content (as defined below) and 

- **(b)** for recipients of such specifications to create, reproduce, and distribute implementations thereof based on the portion of Your Contributions or material derived from them in the specifications, subject to the terms of the then-current GraphOwls projects License(s).

“Specification Content” is the collection of interface definitions for the application or user interfaces (“Interfaces”) provided by the work to which Your Contribution was made, descriptions of the structure and semantic behavior of those Interfaces, and data formats and protocols associated with those Interfaces, all of which as are reasonably necessary to enable the development of independent implementations of those Interfaces. For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation detail of how the GraphOwls project code or Your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provided above would not cover such additional material.

GraphOwls requires that each Contribution You Submit now or in the future to comply with the following commitments documented in the Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco)). To confirm that You have read and agreed to each, please click on the box beside each one.
